# Goal
This project is trying to use assembly to measure 3 main purpose
- Measure
- Show

# Who is this for
- Who want to learn assembly language can use
  - https://github.com/PhuwadonV/AsmMeasure/wiki/MeasureSimple
- 

# Disclaimer
This project may contains incorrect measurement or incorrect annalysis from

# Learning options
- Reading [Wiki](https://github.com/PhuwadonV/AsmMeasure/wiki)
- Download executable file from [Releases](https://github.com/PhuwadonV/AsmMeasure/releases)
  - Requiremennts
    - Windows OS
  - Pros
    - Result from different machine could be varies. Try measuring on your own machine may find more useful infomation for better analysing
- Compile from source files
  - Requiremennts
    - Visual Studio with MSVC
  - Pros
    - Modify code and observe the result. Is it changes? Why is it change (or not)? How is it change?
    - Create your own measurement. This project provide some code and guildline for starting new project
